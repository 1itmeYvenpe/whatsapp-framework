# Mac
Mac is a whatsapp bot I made as a weekend project. The project itself has all you need to make your own custom functions easily.

## Current functions:
+ **`!hi`**: Says hi to sender
+ **`!yt`**: Activates youtube detection
+ **`!siono`**: Random yes or no function. Returns gif and answer from [**yesno.wtf/api**](https://yesno.wtf/api/)
+ **`!poll <title>, <identifier (optional)>`**: Make polls (taking chat as input)
+ **`!<message>`**: If command is not recognized uses IA from Cleverbot to answer
